# Glow Torches

**Glow Torches** is a lightweight and vanilla-friendly mod that adds waterproof torches to Minecraft. The titular **Glow Torches** can be crafted with Glow Ink Sacs and function just like regular torches, except that they can be placed underwater!

They're not quite as bright as regular torches, having a light level of 12, but they have a unique appearance and sparkle nicely. And since Glow Squids can be difficult to find, this mod also adds a recipe to combine regular Ink Sacs with Glowstone Dust to create Glow Ink Sacs.
